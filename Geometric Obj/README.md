#Enable GeometricObject comparable
* Modify the GeometricObject class to implement the Comparable interface.
* Define a static max method in the GeometricObject class for finding the larger of two GeometricObject objects. 
* Write a test program that uses the max method to find the larger of two circles and the larger of two rectangles.
